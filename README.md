Module 6 Challenge - Python and API

Pre-work involves setting up a .gitignore file for the API keys needed for this assignment.

Import the dependencies and keys needed in both parts.

Part 1: WeatherPy

Complete the code provided to prove that it gets hotter the closer one gets to the equator.
1. Fetch a list of random cities from the citypy Python library.
2. Fetch the weather for these cities from OpenWeatherMap API.
3. Save the data so that it doesn't change between attempts to finish the rest of the assignment. Also useful for Part 2.
4. Create scatter plots as requested.
5. Compare the north and south hemispheres with linear regression plots.
6. Describe the relationships found for each camparison.


Part 2: VacationPy

Pretend to plan a future vacation with the city data found in Part 1.
1. Open the data set created in Part 1.
2. Create a map of the cities as directed.
3. Narrow the number of cities down to fit your ideal weather conditions and remove any rows with null values.
